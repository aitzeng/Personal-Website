      <p>Full Stack Software Engineer</p>
      <p>About a year or so ago while working at Amgen, I took an interest in coding after tweaking around with some excell spreadsheets. Cut to today with a few projects under my belt and completing an advanced software engineering immersive course from Hack Reactor, I'm proud to call myself a software engineer! I'm passionate about building applications that help people's everyday or challenge me to expand my knowledge and understanding. </p>
